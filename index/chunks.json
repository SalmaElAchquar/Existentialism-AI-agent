Maurice Merleau-Ponty Although ‘existentialism’ remains a frequently mentioned term and Sartre arguably the most widely recognized philosopher of the 20th century, one often hears the claim that the movement is over; that it has been supplanted by two successive waves of French thought, structuralism in the 1960s and poststructuralism in the 1970s and 1980s, after which the momentum dissipated as the cohort of philosophical personages passed away.

No one has ever seen a unicorn but we have images of what one might see if such a creature existed in the physical world.

Still, in this respect, it can be considered a period piece.

Linguistic signs, for the structuralist, do not ‘name’ objects as people commonly believe that words do, but rather differentiate among the members of a set of signs.

What attracted many postmodern thinkers to Levinas’s position was its rejection of a metaphysical foundation for ethics and its turn to an ethics of responsibility in place of one of universal principles or abstract values. If Levinas had not existed, the postmodernists would have had to invent him. Yet even postmodernists acknowledged the need for basic ethical principles such as ‘justice’, which Jacques Derrida famously claimed was ‘perhaps undeconstructable’. By this, he meant that it was perhaps not liable to Derrida’s usual method (deconstruction) of unravelling the unity of a concept by analysis of the ‘loose ends’ ",

More simply put, justice was perhaps an absolute in a relativistic world. Levinas likewise accorded justice a certain relative ultimacy. For Levinas, justice is derived from the advent of the third party even though it is based on the original responsibility of the face-to-face, his fundamental ethical category. In this sense, justice resembles Sartre’s concept of the upsurge of our ‘being-for-others’ with the appearance of a third person in our midst.

It is at this point that the existentialists’ concept of being-in- situation offers help. Again, it is a case of sensitivity to concrete thinking.

Sartre's existentialist philosophy emerges as a profound exploration of the concept of freedom, deeply rooted in the assertion that \"existence precedes essence\" (Sartre 1956, 568; 630).

The second is consciousness, which exists as 'for-itself' and is inherently relational, always being 'consciousness of something.'

To find new impulses, we now turn to Scheler. We will notice the overlaps with and slight differences from Mounier, Maritain, and Wojtyła, and we will pitch his ideas in contrast to those of Sartre . Scheler emphasizes the centrality of ethics in understanding the human person. Both Scheler and Wojtyła suggest that actions are not just behavior but also moral and value -laden choices.
